# UFOs
Dana wants to build a website of recorded UFO sightings. The website is styled using CSS and a huge data table of UFO sightings. The table includes date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments.

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project is to build a website using java script data and tools. This website displays a searchable user interactive table with multiple  criteria.

### Single Search Criteria
The searchable table is very easy to use. For one search like state, just enter the state's two letter abbreviation in text box. Next, you can either select enter or click outside of text box. The table will automatically update with any matches.

### Multiple Search Criteria
Multiple search criteria are just as easy. For example, you can enter a specific date in first text box and then enter a shape in last text box. The table will automatically update displaying rows where only the two search criteria are met. You can do any combination of the 5 search text boxes.

## Results
One of the biggest drawbacks I discovered while using the searchable table was a clear button. Whenever I wanted to clear my search results, I had to refresh the table. This is this first addition I would add. The second addition is the ability to have multiple criteria in one search box. For example, I might want to see 2/3 states ate once. Another addition would be a date range feature and after/before specific date. Adding these features would enhance the table even more.
